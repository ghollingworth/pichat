Bookshelf
Introduction
Edit this on GitHub
The Bookshelf application in Raspberry Pi OS provides access to books and magazines published by Raspberry Pi Press. Since Raspberry Pi OS Trixie, this also includes contributor-only titles.
-
Free titles are indicated by the cloud icon and can be downloaded by anyone.
-
Contributor-only titles are indicated by the padlock symbol unless you’re signed in with a Raspberry Pi ID that’s associated with a contribution or a subscription to the print magazine. Some contributor-only titles later become available to all.
Bookshelf is included in the Raspberry Pi OS Desktop and Raspberry Pi OS Full images.

Contributor-only titles are available to users who are signed in to Bookshelf with a Raspberry Pi ID that’s associated with one of the following things:
-
An email address that has a subscription to our print magazine
To set up a monthly contribution:
-
In Bookshelf, select Contribute… in the bottom left to open the contributor page on the Raspberry Pi website.
-
If you don’t have a Raspberry Pi ID already, you can create one now. If you have an existing Raspberry Pi ID, sign in with your username and password.
-
Sign up for a monthly contribution.
-
Select Sign in to Bookshelf to open Bookshelf and store your ID that identifies you as a contributor.
The Contribute… button is no longer shown and all titles can now be downloaded.
You can sign in with your Raspberry Pi ID and access available titles from any number of devices. If you move to a new Raspberry Pi or flash your SD with a different version of Raspberry Pi OS, sign in and download your favourite titles again.
Download titles
Double-click on any of the available titles to download them as a PDF and open them in the default PDF reader.
If you stop your monthly contribution, you keep any titles that you’ve already downloaded. These PDF files are stored in the Bookshelf folder of your home directory and remain accessible through Bookshelf.
