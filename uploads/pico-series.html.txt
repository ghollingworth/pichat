-
520 kB of SRAM, and 4 MB of on-board flash memory
-
USB 1.1 with device and host support
-
Low-power sleep and dormant modes
-
Drag-and-drop programming using mass storage over USB
-
26× multi-function GPIO pins including 3 that can be used for ADC
-
2× SPI, 2× I2C, 2× UART, 3× 12-bit 500 ksps Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC), 24× controllable PWM channels
-
2× Timer with 4 alarms, 1× AON Timer
-
Temperature sensor
-
3 × Programmable IO (PIO) blocks, 12 state machines total for custom peripheral support
-
Flexible, user-programmable high-speed IO

-
The Raspberry Pi Pico 2 comes as a castellated module which allows soldering direct to carrier boards, while the Pico 2 with headers comes with pre-soldered headers.
|
Note
|
Both boards have a three pin Serial Wire Debug (SWD) header. However, the Pico 2 with headers breaks this out into a small, keyed, 3-pin connector while the Pico has three castellated through-hole pins adjacent to the edge of the board. |

Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W
Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W adds on-board single-band 2.4 GHz wireless interfaces (802.11n) using the Infineon CYW43439 to the Pico 2 hardware. The on-board 2.4 GHz wireless interface has the following features:
-
Wireless (802.11n), single-band (2.4 GHz)
-
WPA3
-
Soft access point supporting up to four clients
-
Bluetooth 5.2
-
Support for Bluetooth LE Central and Peripheral roles
-
Support for Bluetooth Classic
-
The onboard antenna is licensed from ABRACON (formerly ProAnt). The wireless interface is connected via SPI to the RP2350 microcontroller.
Due to pin limitations, some of the wireless interface pins are shared. The CLK is shared with VSYS monitor, so only when there isn’t an SPI transaction in progress can VSYS be read via the ADC. The Infineon CYW43439 DIN/DOUT and IRQ all share one pin on the RP2350. Only when an SPI transaction isn’t in progress is it suitable to check for IRQs. The interface typically runs at 33 MHz.
For best wireless performance, position the antenna in free space. For instance, metal underneath or nearby the antenna can reduce performance both in terms of gain and bandwidth. Adding grounded metal to the sides of the antenna can improve the antenna’s bandwidth.
libcyw43
is licensed for non-commercial use. However, Pico 2 W users, and anyone else who builds their product around RP2350 and CYW43439, benefit from a free commercial-use license.
In addition to the standard BTstack licensing terms, a supplemental licence covers commercial use of BTstack with Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.

The Raspberry Pi Pico 1 family consists of four boards; Raspberry Pi Pico (far left), Pico H (middle left), Pico W (middle right), and Pico WH (far right).

Raspberry Pi Pico W and Pico WH
Raspberry Pi Pico W adds on-board single-band 2.4 GHz wireless interfaces (802.11n) using the Infineon CYW43439 while retaining the Pico form factor. The on-board 2.4 GHz wireless interface has the following features:
-
Wireless (802.11n), single-band (2.4 GHz)
-
WPA3
-
Soft access point supporting up to four clients
-

Software Utilities
Edit this on GitHub
What is on your Pico-series device?
If you are unsure what is programmed into your Raspberry Pi Pico-series device, and the program was built using the Pico C/C++ SDK, it will usually have a name and other useful information embedded into the binary. You can use the Picotool command line utility to find out these details. Full instructions on how to use Picotool to do this are available in our 'getting started' documentation.
-
Go to the Picotool Github repository.
Debugging using another Pico-series device
You can use one Pico-series device to debug another Pico-series device. This is possible via debugprobe
, an application that allows a Pico to act as a USB → SWD and UART converter.
You can find the latest release of the firmware in the debugprobe GitHub repository.
Download debugprobe_on_pico.uf2
(for Pico) or debugprobe_on_pico2.uf2
(for Pico 2) from the latest release.
Push and hold the BOOTSEL button as you plug the debugger device into your computer to mount a volume called "RPI-RP2".
Copy the UF2 file onto the volume. The volume will dismount automatically after the file finishes copying onto the device.
Your device will reboot and now runs an updated version of the debugprobe
firmware. It is now ready for debugging.

Tip
|
For instructions on how to use the debugger, see Getting Started with Pico-series Microcontrollers. |
Resetting Flash memory
For Pico-series devices, BOOTSEL mode lives in read-only memory inside the RP2040 or RP2350 chip, and can’t be overwritten accidentally. No matter what, if you hold down the BOOTSEL button when you plug in your Pico, it will appear as a drive onto which you can drag a new UF2 file. There is no way to brick the board through software. However, there are some circumstances where you might want to make sure your flash memory is empty. You can do this by dragging and dropping a special UF2 binary onto your Pico when it is in mass storage mode.
