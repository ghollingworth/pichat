Introduction
An introduction to the Pico SDKHardware APIs
This group of libraries provides a thin and efficient C API / abstractions to access the RP-series microcontroller hardware without having to read and write hardware registers directly.High Level APIs
This group of libraries provide higher level functionality that isn't hardware related or provides a richer set of functionality above the basic hardware interfacesThird-party Libraries
Third party libraries for implementing high level functionality.Networking Libraries
Functions for implementing networkingRuntime Infrastructure
Libraries that are used to provide efficient implementation of certain language level and C library functions, as well as CMake INTERFACE libraries abstracting the compilation and link steps in the SDKExternal API Headers
Headers for interfaces that are shared with code outside of the SDK
