The peripheral specification document contains a number of errors. However there is a list of currently known errata. |
Other information regarding the processor can be found in the following documents;
BCM2836
Edit this on GitHub
The Broadcom chip used in early models of Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. The underlying architecture in BCM2836 is identical to BCM2835. The only significant difference is the replacement of the ARM1176JZF-S processor with a quad-core Cortex-A7 cluster.

This SoC is discontinued. Later Raspberry Pi 2 Model B revisions use a different SoC. For more information, see Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Product Change Note. |
BCM2837
Edit this on GitHub
This is the Broadcom chip used in early models of Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, some models of Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3. The underlying architecture of the BCM2837 is identical to the BCM2836. The only significant difference is the replacement of the Armv7 quad core cluster with a quad-core Arm Cortex A53 (Armv8) cluster.
The Arm cores run at 1.2 GHz, making the device about 50% faster than the Raspberry Pi 2. The VideoCore IV runs at 400 MHz.
Please refer to the following BCM2836 document for details on the Arm peripherals specification, which also applies to the BCM2837.

This SoC is discontinued. Raspberry Pi devices that include this chip are either End-of-Life or use a different SoC. For more information, see Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Product Change Notification, Raspberry Pi 2 Model B revisions 1.1 and 1.2 Obsolescence Notice 1, and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 and Compute Module 3 Lite Obsolescence Notice 2. |
BCM2837B0
Edit this on GitHub
This is the Broadcom chip used in later models of Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, later models of Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Raspberry Pi 3 Models A+, B+, and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3+. The underlying architecture of the BCM2837B0 is identical to the BCM2837 chip used in other versions of the Raspberry Pi. The Arm core hardware is the same; only the frequency is rated higher.
The Arm cores are capable of running at up to 1.4 GHz, making the 3B+ and 3A+ about 17% faster than the original Raspberry Pi 3. The VideoCore IV runs at 400 MHz. The Arm core is 64-bit, while the VideoCore IV is 32-bit.
The BCM2837B0 chip is packaged slightly differently to the BCM2837, and most notably includes a heat spreader for better thermals. This allows higher clock frequencies, and more accurate monitoring and control of the chip’s temperature.
This post on the Raspberry Pi blog goes into further detail about the BCM2837B0 chip.
BCM2711
Edit this on GitHub
This is the Broadcom chip used in the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, Compute Module 4, and Pi 400. The architecture of the BCM2711 is a considerable upgrade on that used by the SoCs in earlier Raspberry Pi models. It continues the quad-core CPU design of the BCM2837, but uses the more powerful Arm A72 core. It has a greatly improved GPU feature set with much faster input/output, due to the incorporation of a PCIe link that connects the USB 2 and USB 3 ports, and a natively attached Ethernet controller. It is also capable of addressing more memory than the SoCs used before.
The Arm cores are capable of running at up to 1.5 GHz, making the Raspberry Pi 4 about 50% faster than the Raspberry Pi 3B+. The new VideoCore VI 3D unit now runs at up to 500 MHz. The Arm cores are 64-bit, and while the VideoCore is 32-bit, there is a new Memory Management Unit, which means it can access more memory than previous versions.
The BCM2711 chip continues to use the heat spreading technology started with the BCM2837B0, which provides better thermal management.
Processor: Quad-core Cortex-A72 (Armv8-A) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5 GHz.
Memory: Accesses up to 8 GB LPDDR4-2400 SDRAM (depending on model)
Caches: 32 kB data + 48 kB instruction L1 cache per core. 1 MB L2 cache.
Multimedia: H.265 (4Kp60 decode); H.264 (1080p60 decode, 1080p30 encode); OpenGL ES, 3.0 graphics
I/O: PCIe bus, onboard Ethernet port, 2 × DSI ports (only one exposed on Raspberry Pi 4B), 2 × CSI ports (only one exposed on Raspberry Pi 4B), up to 6 × I2C, up to 6 × UART (muxed with I2C), up to 6 × SPI (only five exposed on Raspberry Pi 4B), dual HDMI video output, composite video output.
The datasheet for the BCM2711 contains further details.
BCM2712
Edit this on GitHub
Broadcom BCM2712 is the 16nm application processor used in Raspberry Pi 5, 500, 500+, and Compute Module 5. It is the successor to the BCM2711 device used in Raspberry Pi 4, and shares many common architectural features with other devices in the BCM27xx family, used on earlier Raspberry Pi products.
Built around a quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 CPU cluster, clocked at up to 2.4 GHz, with 512 kB per-core L2 caches and a 2 MB shared L3 cache, it integrates an improved 12-core VideoCore VII GPU; a hardware video scaler and HDMI controller capable of driving dual 4Kp60 displays; and a Raspberry Pi-developed HEVC decoder and Image Signal Processor. A 32-bit LPDDR4X memory interface provides up to 17 GB/s of memory bandwidth, while ×1 and ×4 PCI Express interfaces support high-bandwidth external peripherals; on Raspberry Pi 5 the latter is used to connect to the Raspberry Pi RP1 south bridge, which provides the bulk of the external-facing I/O functionality on the platform.
Headline features include:
-
Quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 @ 2.4 GHz
-
Armv8-A ISA
-
64 kByte I and D caches
-
512 kB L2 per core, 2 MB shared L3

-
-
4Kp60 HEVC hardware decode
-
Other CODECs run in software
-
H264 1080p24 decode ~10–20% of CPU
-
H264 1080p60 decode ~50–60% of CPU
-
H264 1080p30 encode (from ISP) ~30–40% CPU
-
In aggregate, the new features present in BCM2712 deliver a performance uplift of 2-3× over Raspberry Pi 4 for common CPU or I/O-intensive use cases.
Vulnerabilities and mitigations
The Cortex-A76 CPU used in the BCM2712 SoC has known vulnerabilities that are all mitigated in Raspberry Pi OS.
To determine the full list of vulnerabilities and the mitigations, you can use the following command line which will list all those in place.
$ lscpu | grep Vulnerability | grep -v "Not affected"
Vulnerability Spec store bypass: Mitigation; Speculative Store Bypass disabled via prctl
Vulnerability Spectre v1: Mitigation; __user pointer sanitization
Vulnerability Spectre v2: Mitigation; CSV2, BHB

Warning
|
The list above was correct as of April 2025 but may have been superseded. You should use lscpu on your Raspberry Pi to get up to date information. This is especially important when using a third-party operating system, as these may not include all the latest mitigations in their Linux kernel builds. The Arm processors used by Raspberry Pi Ltd do not use microcode, so all mitigations are at the kernel level.
|
The vulnerability information reported by lscpu
is based on the currently executing kernel’s detection scheme. It may not accurately reflect the true vulnerability status of the hardware, especially if the OS lacks recent kernel updates. Further vulnerability information on the CPU vendor advisories can be obtained from https://developer.arm.com/Arm%20Security%20Center/Speculative%20Processor%20Vulnerability referencing the Vendor ID and Model name reported by lscpu

RP3A0
Edit this on GitHub
The Raspberry Pi RP3A0 is our first System-in-Package (SiP) consisting of a Broadcom BCM2710A1 — which is the silicon die packaged inside the Broadcom BCM2837 chip which is used on the Raspberry Pi 3 — along with 512 MB of DRAM.
It is used by the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
The RP3A0 is a Quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex A53 CPU clocked at 1 GHz, although with a heat sink or other cooling solution in place, the chip can be potentially overclocked to 1.2 GHz.
Please refer to the following BCM2836 document for details on the Arm peripherals specification, which also applies to the BCM2837 and RP3A0.

Note

The original Raspberry Pi Zero uses Package-on-Package (PoP) DRAM, where the DRAM is soldered directly on top of the BCM2835 chip. |
