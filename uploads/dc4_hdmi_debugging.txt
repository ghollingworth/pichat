On a the Pi4 or Pi5 family, to debug issues with no display, you should:

Remove sdcard/SSD/USB and any other connected hardware.
Connect HDMI to primary display port (the one closest to USB power port), and apply power.

Do you see the diagnostic screen? If so, check the "DISPLAY:" line.

It should show:
display: DISP0: HDMI HPD=1 EDID=ok #2 DISP: HDP=0 EDID=none #0

The key elements are:
 HPD=1 (i.e. hotplug is detected indicating HDMI device is attached)
 EDID=ok (i.e. the EDID describing supported modes was read successfully)
 
If either of these are absent then there is a connection issue, typically due to the HDMI cable, or HDMI to micro HDMI adaptor.
  
Note: earlier models of Pi do not support the diagnostic display.

CRITICAL: Do not mention legacy HDMI options like hdmi_force_hotplug
