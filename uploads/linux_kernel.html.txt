The Linux kernel
Introduction
Edit this on GitHub
The Raspberry Pi kernel is hosted on GitHub; updates lag behind the upstream Linux kernel. The upstream kernel updates continuously, whereas Raspberry Pi integrates long-term releases of the Linux kernel into the Raspberry Pi kernel. We generate a next
branch in raspberrypi/firmware for each long-term Linux kernel release. After extensive testing and discussion, we merge each next
branch into the main branch of our repository.
Update
The usual Raspberry Pi OS update process automatically updates your kernel to the latest stable release. If you want to try the latest unstable test kernel, you can manually update.
Build the kernel
Edit this on GitHub
The default compilers and linkers distributed with an OS are configured to build executables to run on that OS. Native builds use these default compilers and linkers. Cross-compilation is the process of building code for a target other than the one running the build process.
Cross-compilation of the Raspberry Pi kernel allows you to build a 64-bit kernel from a 32-bit OS, and vice versa. Alternatively, you can cross-compile a 32-bit or 64-bit Raspberry Pi kernel from a device other than a Raspberry Pi.
The instructions below are divided into native builds and cross-compilation. Choose the section appropriate for your situation; although the two processes share many steps, there are also some important differences.
Download kernel source
Before you can build for any target, you need the kernel source. To get the kernel source, you need Git. Begin by installing Git on your device, if you don’t already have it:
$ sudo apt install git
Next, download the source code for the latest Raspberry Pi kernel:
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux
This can take several minutes.

Tip

The To download a different branch with no history, add the
For a full list of available branches, see the the Raspberry Pi kernel repository. |
Now that you have the kernel source, build a fresh kernel natively or via cross-compilation.
Natively build a kernel
This guide assumes that your Raspberry Pi runs the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS.
First, install the build dependencies:
$ sudo apt install bc bison flex libssl-dev make
Build configuration
This section describes how to apply the default configuration when you build a kernel. You can also configure your kernel in the following ways:
To prepare the default configuration, run the appropriate commands from the table below for your Raspberry Pi model.

Note
|
The 32-bit distribution of Raspberry Pi OS on 4-series devices uses a 32-bit userland, but a 64-bit kernel. To build a 32-bit kernel, set |
Customise the kernel version using LOCALVERSION
To prevent the kernel from overwriting existing modules in /lib/modules
and to clarify that you run your own kernel in uname
output, adjust LOCALVERSION
.
To adjust LOCALVERSION
, change the following line in .config
:
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-v7l-MY_CUSTOM_KERNEL"
|
Tip
|
You can also change this setting graphically with menuconfig at General setup > Local version - append to kernel release. For more information about menuconfig , see the kernel configuration instructions.
|
Build
Next, build the kernel. This step can take a long time, depending on your Raspberry Pi model.
-
Run the following commands to build a 64-bit kernel:
$ make -j6 Image.gz modules dtbs
-
Run the following command to build a 32-bit kernel:
$ make -j6 zImage modules dtbs
|
Tip
|
On multi-core Raspberry Pi models, the make -j<n> option distributes work between cores. This can speed up compilation significantly. Run nproc to see how many processors you have; we recommend passing a number 1.5x your number of processors.
|
Install the kernel
Next, install the kernel modules onto the boot media:
$ sudo make -j6 modules_install
Then, install the kernel and Device Tree blobs into the boot partition, backing up your original kernel.
|
Tip
|
If you don’t want to install the freshly-compiled kernel onto the Raspberry Pi where you run this command, copy the compiled kernel to the boot partition of a separate boot media instead of /boot/firmware/ .
|
To install the 64-bit kernel:
-
Run the following commands to create a backup image of the current kernel, install the fresh kernel image, overlays, README, and unmount the partitions:
$ sudo cp /boot/firmware/$KERNEL.img /boot/firmware/$KERNEL-backup.img $ sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz /boot/firmware/$KERNEL.img $ sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/*.dtb /boot/firmware/ $ sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/firmware/overlays/ $ sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/firmware/overlays/
To install the 32-bit kernel:
-
Create a backup of your current kernel and install the fresh kernel image:
$ sudo cp /boot/firmware/$KERNEL.img /boot/firmware/$KERNEL-backup.img $ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/firmware/$KERNEL.img
-
Depending on your kernel version, run the following command:
-
For kernels up to version 6.4:
$ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb /boot/firmware/
-
For kernels version 6.5 and above:
$ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom/*.dtb /boot/firmware/
-
-
Finally, copy over the overlays and README:
$ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/firmware/overlays/ $ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/firmware/overlays/
Finally, run the following command to reboot your Raspberry Pi and run your freshly-compiled kernel:
$ sudo reboot
|

Alternatively, copy the kernel with a different filename (e.g.

Cross-compile the kernel
First, you will need a suitable Linux cross-compilation host. We tend to use Ubuntu; since Raspberry Pi OS is also a Debian distribution, compilation commands are similar.
Install required dependencies and toolchain
To build the sources for cross-compilation, install the required dependencies onto your device. Run the following command to install most dependencies:
$ sudo apt install bc bison flex libssl-dev make libc6-dev libncurses5-dev
Then, install the proper toolchain for the kernel architecture you wish to build:
-
To install the 64-bit toolchain to build a 64-bit kernel, run the following command:
$ sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-arm64
-
To install the 32-bit toolchain to build a 32-bit kernel, run the following command:
$ sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-armhf
Build configuration
This section describes how to apply the default configuration when you build a kernel. You can also configure your kernel in the following ways:
Enter the following commands to build the sources and Device Tree files:

Build
-
Run the following command to build a 64-bit kernel:
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- Image modules dtbs
-
Run the following command to build a 32-bit kernel:
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- zImage modules dtbs
Install the kernel
Having built the kernel, you need to copy it onto your Raspberry Pi boot media (likely an SD card or SSD) and install the modules.
Find your boot media
First, run lsblk
. Then, connect your boot media. Run lsblk
again; the new device represents your boot media. You should see output similar to the following:
sdb sdb1 sdb2
If sdb
represents your boot media, sdb1
represents the the FAT32
-formatted boot partition and sdb2
represents the (likely ext4
-formatted) root partition.
First, mount these partitions as mnt/boot
and mnt/root
, adjusting the partition letter to match the location of your boot media:
$ mkdir mnt
$ mkdir mnt/boot
$ mkdir mnt/root
$ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 mnt/boot
$ sudo mount /dev/sdb2 mnt/root
Install
Next, install the kernel modules onto the boot media:
-
For 64-bit kernels:
$ sudo env PATH=$PATH make -j12 ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- INSTALL_MOD_PATH=mnt/root modules_install
-
For 32-bit kernels:
$ sudo env PATH=$PATH make -j12 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- INSTALL_MOD_PATH=mnt/root modules_install
|
Tip
|
On multi-core devices, the make -j<n> option distributes work between cores. This can speed up compilation significantly. Run nproc to see how many processors you have; we recommend passing a number 1.5x your number of processors.
|
Next, install the kernel and Device Tree blobs into the boot partition, backing up your original kernel.
To install the 64-bit kernel:
-
Run the following commands to create a backup image of the current kernel, install the fresh kernel image, overlays, README, and unmount the partitions:
$ sudo cp mnt/boot/$KERNEL.img mnt/boot/$KERNEL-backup.img $ sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/Image mnt/boot/$KERNEL.img $ sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/*.dtb mnt/boot/ $ sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* mnt/boot/overlays/ $ sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/overlays/README mnt/boot/overlays/ $ sudo umount mnt/boot $ sudo umount mnt/root
To install the 32-bit kernel:
-
Run the following commands to create a backup image of the current kernel and install the fresh kernel image:
$ sudo cp mnt/boot/$KERNEL.img mnt/boot/$KERNEL-backup.img $ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/zImage mnt/boot/$KERNEL.img
-
Depending on your kernel version, run the following command to install Device Tree blobs:
-
For kernels up to version 6.4:
$ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb mnt/boot/
-
For kernels version 6.5 and above:
$ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom/*.dtb mnt/boot/
-
-
Finally, install the overlays and README, and unmount the partitions:
$ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* mnt/boot/overlays/ $ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/README mnt/boot/overlays/ $ sudo umount mnt/boot $ sudo umount mnt/root
Finally, connect the boot media to your Raspberry Pi and connect it to power to run your freshly-compiled kernel.

Configure the kernel
Edit this on GitHub
The Linux kernel is highly configurable. Advanced users may wish to modify the default configuration to customise it to their needs, such as enabling a new or experimental network protocol, or enabling support for new hardware.
Configuration is most commonly done through the make menuconfig
interface. Alternatively, you can modify your .config
file manually, but this can be more difficult.
Prepare to configure
The menuconfig
tool requires the ncurses
development headers to compile properly. To install these headers, run the following command:
$ sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
Next, download your kernel sources. In particular, ensure you have installed the default native configuration or default cross-compilation configuration.
menuconfig
Once you’ve got everything set up, you can compile and run the menuconfig
utility as follows:
$ make menuconfig
To cross-compile a 64-bit kernel:
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- menuconfig
To cross-compile a 32-bit kernel:
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig
To navigate the menuconfig
utility, use your keyboard:
-
to navigate directionally, use the arrow keys
-
to enter a submenu (indicated by
--->
), press the Enter key -
to go up a level or exit, press Escape twice
-
to toggle the state of a binary option, press the space bar
-
to select the state of a multiple choice option, press Enter to open a submenu, the arrow keys to navigate the submenu, and press Enter again to select a state
-
to get help with an option or menu, press the H key
After a brief compilation, menuconfig
presents a list of submenus containing all the options you can configure. There are many options, so take your time to read through them. Resist the temptation to enable or disable a lot of things on your first attempt; it’s relatively easy to break your configuration, so start small and get comfortable with the configuration and build process.
Save your changes
Once you’re done making changes, press Escape until you’re prompted to save your new configuration. By default, this saves to the .config
file. You can save and load configurations by copying this file.
After customising, you should now be ready to build the kernel.
Patch the kernel
Edit this on GitHub
When building your custom kernel, you may wish to apply patches or collections of patches (patchsets) to the Linux kernel.
Hardware makers sometimes provide patchsets as a temporary measure to support new hardware before the patches make it into the Linux kernel and the Raspberry Pi kernel. However, patchsets for other purposes exist, for instance to enable a fully pre-emptible kernel for real-time usage.
Identify your kernel version
To check the kernel version currently running on your device, run the following command:
$ uname -r
Always check your version of the kernel before applying patches. In a kernel source directory, run the following command to see the kernel version:
$ head Makefile -n 4
You should see output similar to the following:
# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 VERSION = 6 PATCHLEVEL = 1 SUBLEVEL = 38
In this instance, the sources are for a 6.1.38 kernel.
Apply patches
The application of patches depends on the format used to distribute the patch.
Developers distribute most patches as a single file. Use the patch
utility to apply these patches. The following commands download, uncompress, and patch our example kernel version with real-time kernel patches:
$ wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/6.1/patch-6.1.38-rt13-rc1.patch.gz
$ gunzip patch-6.1.38-rt13-rc1.patch.gz
$ cat patch-6.1.38-rt13-rc1.patch | patch -p1
Some developers distribute patches in the mailbox format, a folder containing multiple patch files. Use Git to apply these patches.
|
Note
|
Before using Git to apply mailbox patches, configure your local Git installation with a name and email:
|
To apply the mailbox formatted patches with Git, run the following command:
$ git am -3 /path/to/patches/*
Always follow the instructions provided by the patch distributor. For instance, some patchsets require patching against a specific commit.
Kernel headers
Edit this on GitHub
To compile a kernel module, you need the Linux kernel headers. These provide the function and structure definitions required to compile code that interfaces with the kernel.
If you cloned the entire kernel from GitHub, the headers are already included in the source tree. If you don’t need all the extra files, you can instead install only the kernel headers with apt
.
|
Tip
|
When a new kernel is released, you need the headers that match that kernel version. It can take several weeks to update the apt package to reflect the latest kernel version. For the latest header versions, clone the kernel.
|
If you use a 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS, run the following command to install the kernel headers:
$ sudo apt install linux-headers-rpi-v8
If you use a 32-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS, run the following command to install the kernel headers:
$ sudo apt install linux-headers-rpi-{v6,v7,v7l}
|
Note
|
Installation can take several minutes. There is no progress indicator. |
Contribute
Edit this on GitHub
There are many reasons you may want to put something into the kernel:
-
You’ve written some Raspberry Pi-specific code that you want everyone to benefit from
-
You’ve written a generic Linux kernel driver for a device and want everyone to use it
-
You’ve fixed a generic kernel bug
-
You’ve fixed a Raspberry Pi-specific kernel bug
For Raspberry Pi-specific changes or bug fixes, submit a pull request to the Raspberry Pi kernel. For general Linux kernel changes (i.e. a new driver), submit a pull request to the upstream Linux kernel first. Once the Linux kernel accepts your change, we’ll receive it.
Contribute to the Raspberry Pi Kernel
First, fork the Raspberry Pi kernel repository and clone it to your development device. You can then make your changes, test them, and commit them into your fork.
Then, submit a pull request containing your changes to the Raspberry Pi kernel repository. Raspberry Pi engineers will review your contribution and suggest improvements. Once approved, we’ll merge in your changes, and they’ll eventually make their way to the stable release of the Raspberry Pi kernel.
Contribute to the Linux kernel
First, clone the Linux kernel tree to your development device. You can then make your changes, test them, and commit them into your local tree.
Once your change is ready you can submit it to the Linux kernel community. Linux kernel development happens on mailing lists, rather than on GitHub. In order for your change to become part of Linux, please email it to the community as a patch. Please follow Submitting patches: the essential guide to getting your code into the kernel and Linux kernel coding style in the Linux kernel documentation. Linux kernel contributors will review your contribution and suggest improvements. Once approved, they’ll merge in your changes. Eventually, they’ll make their way into a long-term release of the Linux kernel. Once we’ve tested that long-term release for compatibility with the Raspberry Pi kernel, your changes will make their way into a stable release of the Raspberry Pi kernel.
