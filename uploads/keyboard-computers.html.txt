Getting started
To get up and running with your Raspberry Pi keyboard computer, you can follow the instructions at Getting started with your Raspberry Pi.
If you have a Raspberry Pi 500+ or got your 400 or 500 as part of a kit that includes a microSD card pre-programmed with Raspberry Pi OS, you can skip ahead in the instructions to Set up your Raspberry Pi.
Raspberry Pi 500+ mechanical keys
Each key on Raspberry Pi 500+ has its own mechanical switch underneath the keycap that registers a key press. Raspberry Pi 500+ uses Gateron KS-33 low-profile mechanical switches. By default, Gateron KS-33 switches use coloured stems to indicate switch type (clicky, tactile, or linear). Raspberry Pi 500+ uses clicky Gateron KS-33 switches with a custom grey stem.
Keycaps attach to the cross-shaped stem on top of the Gateron switches. These switches have Cherry MX-compatible, cross-shaped stems, which is the industry standard. For guidance and instructions on removing and replacing keycaps on your Raspberry Pi 500+, see Change your keycaps on this page.
Raspberry Pi 500+ customisation
Raspberry Pi 500+ is the most recent keyboard computer. It offers the following customisation options:
-
Replaceable M.2 SSD storage. For instructions, see Replace your M.2 SSD.
-
Keycap set changes. For instructions, see Change your keycaps.
-
Backlighting presets, colours, and brightness. For instructions, see Customise your backlighting.
For more advanced users, Raspberry Pi 500+ also allows:
-
LED configuration beyond the built-in presets.
-
On-the-fly key remapping.
For more information, see Advanced software settings.
Replace your M.2 SSD
You can expand storage capacity by replacing the M.2 SSD in your Raspberry Pi 500+. You can also use this slot to install a different PCIe peripheral. The Raspberry Pi 500+ supports devices that use the M.2 M key edge connector in the form factors 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280.
To complete this procedure, you need a cross head screwdriver, a flat head screwdriver, and the provided plastic opening tool (spudger).
-
Unscrew the keyboard. Locate the five screws on the bottom of the keyboard and unscrew them using a cross head screwdriver. Keep the screws in a safe place.
-
Loosen the top of the keyboard from the bottom of the keyboard. Position the spudger into the indentation at the front of the keyboard and then angle the spudger upwards to start splitting the keyboard.
-
Detach the top of the keyboard from the bottom of the keyboard. Wedge and swipe the spudger along the opening groove at the front of the keyboard to detach the top of the keyboard from the bottom.
-
Open the keyboard. Place the bottom of the keyboard on a flat surface and fold (don’t lift) the top of the keyboard over to lay it face down on the same surface. Be careful not to pull the top and bottom parts away from each other entirely because they’re attached with a flexible cable.
-
Release the M.2 SSD. By hand or with a flat head screwdriver, turn the screw on the right side of the M.2 SSD anticlockwise to loosen it. Remove the screw and keep it in a safe place. The M.2 SSD springs up when you remove the screw.
-
Pull out the M.2 SSD. Pull the M.2 SSD away from and then out of the keyboard.
-
Add a new M.2 SSD. Insert another M.2 SSD by sliding it into the slot at the left side. The SSD card fits in only one orientation. Hold the newly inserted M.2 SSD down and replace the screw on the right side of it, turning the screw clockwise to tighten.
-
Close the keyboard. Fold the top of the keyboard back onto the bottom of the keyboard and click it back into place.
-
Screw the keyboard shut. Place and turn the five screws back into place with your cross head screwdriver.
Change your keycaps
You can swap out the default keycaps on your Raspberry Pi 500+ for custom sets. Because the Gateron KS-33 switches on Raspberry Pi 500+ use the industry standard Cherry MX stem shape, most third-party keycaps that are designed for Cherry MX are compatible. Avoid taller profiles that could hit the keyboard frame or produce too much noise. For more guidance on choosing alternative keycaps, see Keyboard layout, Keycap profiles, and Lighting in this section.
To remove a keycap:
-
Insert the prongs of the keycap puller on opposite sides of a keycap that you want to remove or replace. Allow the prongs to fall below the keycap.
-
Press the sides of the prongs to grip the keycap, ensuring equal pressure on both sides.
-
Gently pull the keycap straight up off of the keyboard. Avoid pulling at an angle.
|
Note
|
You can also remove keycaps to allow you to clean underneath them. |
You can now replace the keycap with another one, or reinstall the same keycap in its original place:
-
Align the keycap by lining up its cross-shaped stem underneath it with the cross-shaped stem on the corresponding switch.
-
Press the keycap down gently but firmly until the keycap is fully seated and feels secure.
Keyboard layout
Keycaps are available in various languages, with US layouts being the most widely available, followed by UK layouts. Other languages can be harder to source.
The Raspberry Pi 500+ keyboard has a modified 75% layout, which means that some keys are non-standard and might not have matching keycaps in typical sets:
-
Power key. The power key in the top-right corner of the keyboard might not be included in other keycap sets.
-
Lighting labels. The lighting labels on the F4, F5, and F6 keys of Raspberry Pi 500+ are non-standard.
-
Volume labels. The volume labels on the F10, F11, and F12 keys of Raspberry Pi 500+ are non-standard.
-
System Request key. The SysRq key on Raspberry Pi 500+ is non-standard.
-
Insert key. The Ins key on Raspberry Pi 500+ is non-standard.
-
Command key. The Cmd key typically says Win on keycap sets, and third-party keycap sets don’t include the Raspberry Pi logo.
Keycap profiles
The low-profile keycaps included on Raspberry Pi 500+ perform like traditional mechanical keys while also keeping the keyboard compact. We recommend DSA or Cherry profiles for replacement keycaps:
-
DSA keycaps have a flat profile and can be swapped across rows.
-
Cherry keycaps are generally compatible, but have different sculpted profiles for ergonomics. This means that each row can have a slightly different height or angle. For a consistent feel, check row alignment.
|
Note
|
XDA, OEM, and SA keycaps aren’t recommended because they’re taller, and can therefore produce more noise or come into contact with the keyboard frame. |
Customise your backlighting
Raspberry Pi 500+ has most backlighting turned off by default. The only lighting that’s enabled by default includes:
-
The activity LED behind the power button when the Raspberry Pi 500+ keyboard is on. This LED:
-
Is red when Raspberry Pi 500+ is receiving power but is turned off.
-
Is green when Raspberry Pi 500+ is turned on.
-
Blinks with SD card activity.
-
-
The rainbow lighting animation that travels through the keys when you start up the Raspberry Pi 500+ keyboard. Advanced users can turn this off for particular backlighting presets using the configuration software. For more information, see Change preset startup animation in Advanced software settings.
-
The Caps Lock indicator that lights up when active.
Raspberry Pi 500+ supports other RGB backlighting presets, powered by Vial QMK firmware. For instructions, see Choose backlight preset.
Choose backlight preset
Raspberry Pi 500+ comes with seven presets, which are the saved lighting profiles on your Raspberry Pi 500+ keyboard. To cycle forwards through these presets, press Fn + F4 on the keyboard; to cycle backwards through these presets, press Fn + Shift + F4 on the keyboard.
| Preset name | Description | |
|---|---|---|

Solid colour backlight, which you can change using Fn + F3. |
3 |
Gradient Left Right |
Fixed rainbow backlight. |
4 |
Cycle Pinwheel |
Animated rainbow backlight, where the keys cycle through different colours in a rainbow pattern across the keyboard. |
5 |
Typing Heatmap |
The more you press a key, the closer to red it gets and the more the keys around it light up. |
6 |
Solid Reactive Simple |
Reactive keyboard, where the keys light up when you press them. You can choose which colour using Fn + F3. |
Backlight controls
You can customise the RGB backlighting colour (depending on the preset) and brightness using the following keyboard shortcuts:
-
Change colour. Press Fn + F3 to cycle forwards through 16 backlight colours; press Fn + Shift + F3 to cycle backwards through the colours.
-
Adjust brightness. Press Fn + F5 to reduce the brightness; press Fn + F6 to increase the brightness.
|
Note
|
The Shift key on your keyboard either cycles backwards through available options, or inverts the key function. For example, Fn + Shift + F5 increases the brightness instead of decreasing it. |
Advanced software settings

Advanced LED settings
Advanced users can customise Raspberry Pi 500+ backlighting beyond the basic presets. Specifically, the rpi-keyboard-config
software allows you to:
-
Add other lighting effects to your Raspberry Pi 500+, temporarily or as presets. For information, see Lighting effects.
-
Set a different startup animation for each preset. For information, see Change preset startup animation.
-
Add speed, saturation, and hue parameters to an effect or preset. For information, see Effect and preset parameters.
-

-
Control individual LED lighting by configuring and then applying the
direct
effect. For information, see Individual LED controls.
|
Note
|
Advanced LED settings are only available for Raspberry Pi 500+ because only this model of keyboard computer has backlit keys. |
Lighting effects
You can control Raspberry Pi 500+ backlighting through various effects and parameters. With the exception of the power button, which is unaffected by any effect, keyboard lighting effects are controlled through the configuration software. With this software, you can:
-
Temporarily apply an effect to the keyboard until you shut down and restart the keyboard, or until you start to cycle through the presets again. Cycling through the presets continues from the last preset before you applied a temporary effect.
-
Assign an effect to one of the seven keyboard presets. The default presets are listed in Choose backlight preset. You can also add parameters and startup animations to presets.
Use the following commands to choose, apply, and view a temporary effect on your keyboard.
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
|
List available lighting effects. |
|
Temporarily apply an effect, replacing |
|
View the currently active effect. |
You can also adjust the following parameters for an effect: speed, saturation, and hue. For example, the following command changes the speed of the "Cycle Spiral"
effect to 42.
$ rpi-keyboard-config effect "Cycle Spiral" --speed 42
Any parameter you add must be a number between 0 and 255. For more information about these parameters, including when they are and aren’t useful to add, see Effect and preset parameters.
View presets
You can use the configuration software to check which preset you’re on, move between them, or see details about each one. Each preset has an index number between 0 and 6, representing the seven available slots.
| Command | Description | Example (assuming default presets) |
|---|---|---|
|
Show the index of the current preset. |
If you’re currently on the Gradient Left Right preset, this command tells you that you’re on preset 3. |
|
Skip to a different position in the preset cycle, where |
The following command takes you to the Typing Heatmap preset:
|
|
List all current presets. |
This command lists the seven presets, numbered 0 to 6. Default presets are summarised in Choose backlight preset. |
|
Show details about a specific preset, where |
The following command tells you that preset 5 is the Typing Heatmap preset:
|
Reassign presets
You can reassign presets to use different effects. For information about effects, including how to obtain a list of available effects, see Lighting effects.
|
Note
|
Changes you make to presets persist every time you restart your Raspberry Pi 500+. You can reset your presets to default at any time using the instructions in Reset presets and LED customisations. |
The following example changes the Gradient Left Right (3
) preset to an effect that you specify in the quotation marks.
$ rpi-keyboard-config preset set 3 "effect-name"
While reassigning a preset, you can add one or more of the following parameters: speed, hue, or saturation. You can also set a specific startup animation for that preset. For information about these options, see Effect and preset parameters and Change preset startup animation.
For example, the following command replaces the default Gradient Left Right preset with the Rainbow Beacon effect at a speed of 140. It would also replace the default startup animation for that preset so that the startup animation finishes on white LEDs and then fades into the Rainbow Beacon effect.
$ rpi-keyboard-config preset set 3 "Rainbow Beacon" --speed 140 --startup-animation "START_ANIM_W_FADE_SAT"
Change preset startup animation
For each preset, you can specify a startup animation with the following command:
$ --startup-animation "name_of_animation"
Replace name_of_animation
with one of the following five possible startup animations:
| Startup animation name | Description |
|---|---|
|
No startup animation. |
|
Pulsing rainbow animation followed by blank LEDs and then immediately into the chosen effect. |
|
Pulsing rainbow animation followed by blank LEDs fading into the chosen effect. This is the default startup animation. |
|
Pulsing rainbow animation followed by white LEDs and then immediately into the chosen effect. |
|
Pulsing rainbow animation followed by white LEDs fading into the chosen effect. |
For example, the following command would replace the startup animation for preset 3 with a pulsing rainbow animation that finishes on white LEDs and then fades into the preset:
$ rpi-keyboard-config preset set 3 --startup-animation "START_ANIM_W_FADE_SAT"
Effect and preset parameters
You can add the following speed, saturation, and hue parameters to any effect or preset:
-
Speed. To set the speed, add
--speed X
to the command, whereX
is a number between 0 and 255. If you don’t add the speed parameter, the default speed is 128. -
Saturation. To set the saturation, add
--sat X
to the command, whereX
is a number between 0 and 255. If you don’t add the saturation parameter, the default is 255 (maximum saturation). -
Hue. To set the hue, add
--hue X
to the command, whereX
is a number between 0 and 255. If you don’t set a hue, the default is to use the global hue of the keyboard, which is set with Fn + F3 on the keyboard. For more information, see Backlight controls.
Some effects and presets are unaffected by some parameters. For example, a solid colour is a static effect and so isn’t affected by a speed change.
Global lighting controls
Hue and brightness are managed on a range of 0 to 255. You can view and set the hue and brightness of your Raspberry Pi 500+ by adding hue
and brightness
to the rpi-keyboard-config
command.
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
|
Show the current global hue (colour) of your Raspberry Pi 500+. |
|
Set the global hue, where |
|
Show the current lighting brightness of your Raspberry Pi 500+. |
|
Set the lighting brightness, where |
Individual LED controls
You can customise the backlighting of individual LEDs on your Raspberry Pi 500+. This is useful for precise visual tweaks and for creating unique backlight patterns.
All the individual LED customisations that you can make are applied to an effect called direct
. You then apply the direct
effect either:
-
Temporarily using the instructions in Lighting effects.
-
By assigning it to a preset using the instructions on Reassign presets.
If the direct
effect is not already applied by one of the preceding methods, it is automatically temporarily applied when running any of the individual LED customisations.
The following table lists commands to set LED colours (globally or for each LED), and save and load LED configurations.
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
|
Turn off all LEDs except the power button. |
|
Specify the colour of all the LEDs. Replace |
|
Specify the colour of a specific LED, where the LED is the row and column co-ordinates ( |

In the following example, the specific LED referenced by the row and column co-ordinates ("2,6"
) is set to green with hue-saturation-value (HSV) numbers ("85,255,255"
):
$ rpi-keyboard-config led set "2,6" --colour "85,255,255"
Remap keys on your keyboard
Advanced users can remap the keys on both a Raspberry Pi 500 and 500+, allowing you to customise your keyboard layout to match your workflow or gaming needs.
Use the rpi-keyboard-config
software to:
-
List all keycodes available for remapping. For information, see List keycodes.
-
Check the current keymap. For information, see View keymap.
-
Remap the keys on your keyboard. For information, see Remap keys.
-
Watch key presses in the configuration software. For information, see Watch key presses.
-
Edit up to four key-mapping layers. For information, see Manage layers.
-
Reset your keyboard to the default key mapping. For information, see Reset to default keyboard layout.
The Raspberry Pi 500 and 500+ are compatible with Vial. You can use the Vial web UI to remap your keys. For information, see Remap keys with Vial.
List keycodes
To remap your keyboard, you need to know the keycodes for the keys you want to assign on your Raspberry Pi 500 or 500+. The following command lists all possible keycodes:
$ rpi-keyboard-config list-keycodes
You can also list only the keycodes in a specific category using --category
. For example, the following command lists all the keycodes for the basic
category:
$ rpi-keyboard-config list-keycodes --category basic
View keymap
Use the following command to see how keys are currently mapped on all positions on your keyboard:
$ rpi-keyboard-config key get-all
Use the following command to see the keycode for a specific key at a position that you specify with the key’s row and column co-ordinates. Replace <row>
and <column>
with the appropriate numbers:
$ rpi-keyboard-config key get <row> <column>
|
Note
|
You can check a key’s row-column co-ordinates using rpi-keyboard-config info --ascii . This provides a layout diagram of the keyboard.
|
For example, to get the keycode for the Q key (with the row-column co-ordinates 2 2
) on your keyboard:
$ rpi-keyboard-config key 2 2
Remap keys
Use the following command to set a different keycode at a position that you specify with the key’s row and column. Replace <row>
and <column>
with the appropriate numbers, and replace <keycode>
with the keycode that you want to map to the specified key.
$ rpi-keyboard-config key set <row> <column> <keycode>
|
Note
|
You can check a key’s row-column co-ordinates using rpi-keyboard-config info --ascii . You can check a key’s keycode using rpi-keyboard-config list-keycodes .
|
For example, if you wanted to remap Q (with the row-column co-ordinates 2 2
) on your keyboard as R (with the keycode KC_R
):
$ rpi-keyboard-config key set 2 2 KC_R
Watch key presses
You can read the state of keys to monitor key activity inside the configuration tool to tell you which keys are pressed and released. Before you can do this, you must unlock the keyboard.
To check the lock status of your keyboard:
$ rpi-keyboard-config info
To unlock your keyboard so that you can then watch key presses:
$ rpi-keyboard-config unlock
The configuration tool guides you through holding down specific keys until a countdown completes. By default, the keys are Enter + Escape, which light up in red to guide you. If you’ve remapped these keys, the unlock sequence uses the physical positions of those keys, not their new labels; the command tells you which remapped keys to press for your setup.
When the keyboard is unlocked, you can monitor key activity with the following command:
$ rpi-keyboard-config key watch
This prints to the terminal whenever a key is pressed or released. For LED feedback, the keys on the keyboard also light up red as you press them. To remove the light-up functionality while watching key presses, add --no-leds
to the above command:
$ rpi-keyboard-config key watch --no-leds
Lock your keyboard when you’re done. The following lock
command doesn’t require any confirmation; it locks the keyboard immediately.
$ rpi-keyboard-config lock
Manage layers
You can set different key mappings on different layers. There are four layers that you can edit, numbered 0–3; the default layer is 0. By default, the Fn key changes the keyboard from layer 0 to layer 1. You can add --layer
to any of the following commands, as appropriate:
-
rpi-keyboard-config key get-all
-
rpi-keyboard-config key get
-
rpi-keyboard-config key set
Reset to default keyboard layout
The following command resets your keyboard layout to the default key mappings, including resetting all layers:
$ rpi-keyboard-config reset-keymap
Remap keys with Vial
Vial works with your keyboard firmware to configure your keyboard in real time.
-
On your Raspberry Pi 500 or 500+, go to Vial web interface.
-
In the window that appears, select your keyboard and click Connect.
-
Use the Vial web interface to change your key mappings.
For information about how to use Vial, see the Vial documentation.
|
Note
|
We recommend that you use Vial only for working with the key mapping and not for customising the RGB LEDs. |
Return to default settings
Your software-controlled preferences are saved in flash memory and persist after reboot and firmware updates. To reset your backlight settings and keyboard layout, wipe the flash area that they’re stored in with the following command:
$ sudo rpi-keyboard-fw-update -w -i
This clears all customisations and restores the keyboard to default backlighting and key mapping.
If the keyboard layout has been misconfigured to the extent that input on the Raspberry Pi 500+ is no longer possible, you can still complete a reset to default settings by connecting an external USB keyboard to one of the available USB ports and entering the command from that device instead.

For a bit of fun, the following command allows you to use the keyboard backlighting to play a basic Flappy Bird-style game on Raspberry Pi 500+:
$ rpi-keyboard-config game
The game uses your keyboard backlighting as the "screen", and the lights flash in patterns to represent the bird and pipes. Your goal is to keep the bird from hitting pipes, similar to the original Flappy Bird. Press the space bar to fly over pipes (lit-up LEDs). Your "bird" continues to drop until you press the space bar. Your score is determined by the number of pipes you’ve successfully passed, which is indicated by the number of purple LEDs along the top of the keyboard.
To exit the game, press Q on your keyboard.
